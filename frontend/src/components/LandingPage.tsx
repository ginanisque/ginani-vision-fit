  },
  {
    question: 'What measurements can VisionFit support?',
    answer: 'The workflow is being built for garment measurements such as bust, waist, hip, shoulder and vertical body landmarks. Every result remains subject to quality checks and professional review.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are my photos public?',
    answer: 'No. Captures are stored in private object storage and associated with your authenticated account. They are used for the measurement workflow you consent to.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does VisionFit replace a professional fitting?',
    answer: 'No. VisionFit assists capture and measurement analysis. A trained reviewer may correct landmarks, request a new capture, or verify measurements before they are used for garment construction.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why might I be asked to retake an image?',
    answer: 'Blur, poor lighting, incomplete framing, unsuitable posture, or an obscured body outline can make a measurement unreliable. The app explains what needs to be corrected.',
